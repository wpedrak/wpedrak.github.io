It is 5 months after Christmas and I'm still amazed by the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), set of 25 programming exercises. Yes, you guessed: there is one exercise per day for every day of the advent.
Your task is to collect 50 stars to save the Christmas. For every year there is a nice storyline that gets you even more addicted. So far I've completed 4 out of 5 stories. I highly recommend you to check it. If you are stuck, feel free to check my repositories for ideas of solution.
