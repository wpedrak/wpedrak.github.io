There is a game MergeDragons [Merge Dragons!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramgames.mergedragons&hl=pl). Nothing spectacular. You merge items in groups of 3 (or 5) to get 1 (or 2) items of higher level. Once you start playing (or at least watching someone playing) it is an almost immediate way of thinking: I need 2 items of level 6, so it is 5 items of level 5, so I need 13 of level 4... 

Sounds like programming challenge. To make it more challenging: we want to publish it on the internet and have at least some monitoring of our service. It is not so hard, even for free. You can check [my webpage](http://mdcheck.herokuapp.com/), if you are interested in code, look at [github](https://github.com/wpedrak/md_checker). Last but not least, if you are interested in services that I've used (and which have free plans), here is the list:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a place where code runs, they also provide you subdomain of in *.herokuapp.com to make your application available from the internet.
- [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/) gives you a log management system. In easy words: you can browse your logs and search through it.
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) provides you error monitoring tool, that can send you an email with a stack trace and suggest which commit introduced this error.
- [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/) allows you to call your website as often as once per minute. I'm using it for 
  - health checks as it can mail you if your server responds with non 200 status,
  - to prevent Heroku's dyno (that's their name for a virtual machine) cold start.

All of those includes free plan and any of them is worth checking if you don't know them yet.
