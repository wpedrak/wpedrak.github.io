Feel free to check out access system called [Open doors](https://github.com/ksiuwr/projekt_drzwi_otwarte) that we did (with [@ksiuwr](https://github.com/ksiuwr)).

The system is based on student cards. The whole software is written in Python3 and works on Raspberry Pi 3. Infrastructure is managed by Ansible.
