If you ever played Minecraft and are coding lover at the same time, you will love [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/): cross-OS, OpenSource voxel game with great modding API in Lua. Using latter I've created (as a project of Lua Course) [Fancy TNT](https://github.com/wpedrak/fancy_tnt) mod which targets the repetitive nature of building big structures. Any feedback is welcomed.
